    "1. Astropy is an open-source core Python package developed by and for the community with a purpose to serve astronomy and astrophysics.It is primarily concerned with providing standardized, efficient, and robust tools to professional astronomers and researchers.It has a wide range of functionalities including unit conversion, celestial coordinate systems, time conversion, FITS file operations, cosmology calculations, etc. Astropy offers a library of platforms to build advanced pipelines of observational and theoretical astrophysics through the integration of many tasks individually completed by a mixture of ad hoc software and homegrown scripts.\n",
    "2. I selected Astropy because I was particularly interested in its model and fit system, which gives a convenient mechanism for specifying analytical models and fitting them to data. This is essential throughout most of astronomy, such as spectral line fitting, photometric curve fitting, and kinematic modeling. The systematic approach to specifying models, combining them, and using optimization routines made it both powerful and convenient. Along with its common use by the community of astronomers, this facet served to distinguish Astropy to me as a utility and learning tool that was worth exploring.\n",
    "3. Astropy originally came out in 2011 as a mother project to bring together numerous disjoint astronomy-specific Python packages into a single, properly documented library. Astropy now has developed into the foundation of the Python astronomy stack. Before Astropy, astronomers used to utilize single packages or IDL routines for FITS file manipulations and coordinate conversions. For general modeling and fitting, SciPy—more precisely scipy.optimize.curve_fit—has been the standard for generic data fitting. However, Astropy's modeling subpackage is a more organized and astronomy-focused solution, with features such as integrated analytical models, unit support, and the ability to compose models. Astropy has also influenced or integrated similar packages like photutils and specutils, extending its functionality through a larger ecosystem.\n",
    "4. Yes, Astropy is actively maintained by a large collaborative community under the Astropy Project, not one author. While a few of the original authors remain active, the project has grown with hundreds of contributors worldwide. Its development takes place on GitHub, where users can readily obtain information on how to contribute, including reporting bugs, making pull requests, writing tests, and improving documentation. The project also has regular releases and formal governance, indicating a high level of long-term maintenance and community involvement.\n",
    "5. Installing Astropy was smooth and well-documented. I followed the official recommendation from the Astropy website and used the command below, which installs the core package along with optional but useful dependencies. The installation completed without any problems, and the package was ready to use immediately."

    "6. As explained above it could be directly installed with a pip/conda command\n",
    "7. Yes, the source code for Astropy is fully open-source and publicly available. While running pip install astropy[recommended] installs the package for use, the actual codebase can be inspected and contributed to via its GitHub repository at https://github.com/astropy/astropy. The repository is well-organized, with clearly labeled subdirectories for each module (e.g., modeling, io, units), and includes documentation, issue tracking, and contribution guidelines. This transparency makes it easy to understand the internal workings of the package, troubleshoot, or even extend it for custom use.\n",
    "8. Yes, Astropy is used as a base library by many other Python astronomy packages. A good example is Photutils, which uses Astropy's data structures and units to perform aperture and point-spread function (PSF) photometry. Another is Specutils, which is a package for spectroscopic data analysis that relies on Astropy's SpectralCoord, units, and modeling tools. Many other packages in the broader Astropy ecosystem and standalone astronomy projects depend on Astropy due to its stability and community conventions. Its popularity also makes it a center of modern astronomical software development.\n",
    "9. Astropy is primarily designed to be called within Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks, making it well-suited for interactive data analysis and reproducible research. It is not well-suited for command-line or web-based interfaces, though it can be part of larger applications with those front-ends. The package's tool support for packages like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, together with its module-based design, also render it well adapted for Jupyter settings, where result, code, and visualisation can be amalgamated into a single environment. The bulk of official tutorial and example descriptions are notebooks by nature, driving this application as well. Below is one example of the custom model creation from astropy.modelling"
