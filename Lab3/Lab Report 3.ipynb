    "This report presents an analysis of real data from the ATLAS experiment at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC), focusing on the reconstruction of the $Z^0$ boson mass from its decay into charged lepton pairs ($Z^0 \\rightarrow \\ell^+ \\ell^-$). Using a dataset of $5000$ proton-proton collision events, I computed the invariant mass of each lepton pair and constructed a histogram of the distribution. A Breit-Wigner fit was applied to extract the best-fit mass and width of the $Z^0$ boson, followed by a two-dimensional $\\chi^2$ parameter scan to assess the uncertainty and correlation between the parameters. The analysis provides insight into electroweak processes and demonstrates key techniques in particle data interpretation."

This strong agreement confirms that the data and analysis procedures used effectively capture the key features of $Z^0$ boson decay. The goodness-of-fit was validated by a reduced chi-square value of approximately $\\chi^2/\\text{ndof} \\approx 1.0$, and a $p-value: 0.4$ that falls well within the acceptable range ($0.05 < p < 0.95$), suggesting no statistically significant disagreement between the model and the data."

    "However, some simplifying assumptions were made in the analysis. Systematic uncertainties—detector calibration errors, energy resolution effects, and lepton identification efficiency—were not included. Such effects would broaden the observed resonance peak or shift the measured mass. Statistical (Poisson) errors alone were assumed for the histogram bin uncertainties. The normalization of the Breit-Wigner function was also held fixed rather than being included as a fit parameter, which could influence the best parameter values."

    "Future studies can improve upon these limitations by incorporating realistic detector simulations and systematic uncertainty estimates. Energy smearing and detector resolution simulation, based on ATLAS calibration data, would lead to more accurate fits. Extension of this analysis to other decay channels or application to other particles such as the $W$ and Higgs bosons could provide further validation of the analysis technique and further insight into electroweak interactions."
